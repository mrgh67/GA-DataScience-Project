Classifiying Images - CIFAR-10
==============================

General Assembly Data Science Project 2014

Building a classification engine for the CIFAR-10 tiny image database.

Documentation for this project can be found in the Wiki: https://github.com/mrgh67/GA-DataScience-Project/wiki

Only iPyhton notebooks in this main directory should be reviewed.

Notebook1 was the first experimental notebook looking at the data

GADS-Proj-Code.ipynb is a notebook with all the code developed. 

NB: The code needs a complete re-write!

In the other notebooks - GADS-Proj-CascadeDemo.ipynb, GADS-Proj-TenClassDemo.ipynb & GADS-Proj-FileMoveDemo.ipynb the code is contained in the module "mystuff.py", which is in the ds directory. 

The code in the module is identical to the code in the "GADS-Proj-Code" iPython notebook.
